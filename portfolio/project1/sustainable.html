                <p class="projectsection">Problem:</p>
                <p class="projecttext">How do you design a game that encourages players to be sustainable 
                    without being too dull or depressing?</p>

                <p class="projectsection">Design Solution:</p>
                <p class="projecttext">
                    My team and I decided to create card game where players need to work together to overcome environmental problems like oil spills or wildfires. 
                    Through their actions and choices throughout the game, they learn more about sustainability and how they can make an impact on the real world. 
                    The game uses positive psychology and pro-social interactions to encourage users to be more sustainable in the game and in real life.
