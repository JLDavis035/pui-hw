                    To preface, this project focused more on gaining experience in using visual design elements. When I think of 
                    concerts, I think of chaotic excitement, vibrant flashing colors, and a lively energy. I wanted to capture these feelings
                    in my website design. A gradient with highly saturated blue colors was used. Long, flowing shapes were added to the background,
                    which look similar to sound bars. These provide texture and frame each section.
