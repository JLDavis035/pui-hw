                <p class="projecttext">How do you balance the excitement of a children's museum while still making it
                    accessible for parents and teachers?

                    My main focus was creating a clear, concise layout that is easy to navigate while still maintaining
                    a whimsical air for kids. I paid great detail to the information architecture, putting the most important 
                    information like buying tickets, exhibits, and events on the landing page. Less vital information like educational
                    resources and an about page can be accessed at the top of the nav bar. Finally, I used vibrant colors and rounded shapes
                    to make the website appear more kid-friendly.
